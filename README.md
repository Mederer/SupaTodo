# SupaTodo

Simple REST API for managing a collection of todo items implemented using ASP.NET Core.

I'm developing this as I learn C# and .NET

## Running the application

You can run the application with the following command:

```sh
dotnet run --project Presentation
```

## Sending requests

Sample requests are found in the Requests folder. The VSCode extension "Rest Client" is recommended to execute these requests.
